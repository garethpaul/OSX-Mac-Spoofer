## Repository purpose

`garethpaul/OSX-Mac-Spoofer` is a legacy macOS utility for changing a local network interface MAC address with `networksetup`, `airport`, and `ifconfig`. Use it only on machines and networks where you have permission to administer the interface.

## Project structure

- `Makefile` - repository verification targets
- `scripts` - baseline checks and helper scripts
- `docs` - plans, notes, and generated README assets

## Development commands

- Install dependencies: no repository-specific install command is documented.
- Full baseline: `make check`
- Combined verification: `make verify`
- Lint/static checks: `make lint`
- Tests: `make test`
- Build: `make build`
- If a command above skips because a platform toolchain is missing, verify on a machine with that SDK before claiming platform behavior is tested.

## Coding conventions

- Language mix noted in the README: Python (1).
- Prefer dependency-free tests or stdlib checks when legacy packages are unavailable.

## Testing guidance

- Test-related files detected: `test_spoof_mac_address.py`
- Start with the narrowest relevant test or Make target, then run `make check` before handing off if the change is not documentation-only.
- Keep README verification notes in sync when commands, fixtures, or supported toolchains change.

## PR / change guidance

- Keep diffs focused on the requested repository and avoid unrelated modernization or formatting churn.
- Preserve public APIs, sample behavior, file formats, and documented environment variables unless the task explicitly changes them.
- Update tests, README notes, or docs/plans when behavior, security posture, or validation commands change.
- Call out skipped platform validation, legacy toolchain assumptions, and any risky files touched in the final summary.

## Safety and gotchas

- No required secret or credential file was identified in the repository scan. If you add integrations later, keep secrets out of git.
- Do not commit network captures, interface inventories, local machine names, or organization-specific MAC addresses.
- Changing network identifiers can affect access controls, network logs, and policy enforcement. Keep this tool explicit, local, and operator-controlled.
- The validator rejects multicast and all-zero MAC address values before command construction. Spoofed values must also be locally administered addresses.
- Observed command output is normalized without requiring the local-admin bit, so hardware address reporting does not block a legitimate local change.
- Non-string MAC address and interface values should fail validation before any command arguments are built.

## Agent workflow

1. Inspect the README, Makefile, manifests, and the files directly related to the request.
2. Make the smallest source or docs change that satisfies the task; avoid generated, vendored, or local-environment files unless required.
3. Run the narrowest useful validation first, then `make check` or the documented package/platform gate when available.
4. If a required SDK, service credential, or external runtime is unavailable, record the skipped command and why.
5. Summarize changed files, commands run, and remaining risks or follow-up validation.
